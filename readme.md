# Massif Rescue Game

This is a basic adventure game that was built in python for a class
project in Udacity. 

I'm also using it to learn about GitHub and version control. (-:

The game allows people to enter their name and a friends name, and go through a funny, slightly chance driven venture. 

Project skills I had to learn to create this included using global variables for functions, and adding/subtracting/displaying 
lists of what the player currently has in their packpack. Also had to modify some functions to make sure user inputs
were always correct.

I don't know exactly what to put in a Read.me file- would be great if Udacity covered that...
